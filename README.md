# AWS Hosted Portfolio Site

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to deploy and host my personal portfolio website on the AWS cloud infrastructure. The website is accessible via the domain XYZ.com. The project aims to exhibit the deployment of a robust, highly available, and scalable web server that can withstand infrastructure failures and seamlessly integrates with a custom registered domain name.

## Alternatives
While several straightforward methods exist to host a basic static website, such as directly uploading web content to Amazon S3 or utilizing GitHub Pages, this project pursues a more comprehensive challenge. The emphasis on deploying web servers through EC2 instances, utilizing Auto Scaling Groups, leveraging Application Load Balancers, and managing content through S3 buckets aligns with enterprise-grade architectural paradigms. These practices ensure high availability, fault tolerance, scalability, and efficient resource utilization, reflecting the principles commonly employed in large-scale, mission-critical applications.


## Infrastructure Components
- **AWS EC2 Instances**: Hosting the Apache web servers running on Amazon Linux. 
- **Launch Configuration & Auto Scaling Group**: Utilized for deploying instances and managing scaling based on demand.
- **S3 Bucket**: Storing the website content files, fetched by instances during launch and copied into the Apache default document root (var/www/html).
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Attached to the Target Group of the Web Server instances, distributing incoming traffic efficiently.
- **Route 53 (R53)**: Creating an A record in the R53 hosted zone for the pre-registered domain name, routing traffic to the ALB's DNS name.

## Infrastructure Features
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Auto Scaling Group uses a dynamic scaling policy monitoring CPU utilization to scale web server performance as needed.
- **High Availability**: Application Load Balancer ensures traffic distribution across multiple instances, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Security Measures**: Implementation of Security Groups & IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege, restricting traffic to necessary ports and providing limited access only to required S3 buckets housing web content.

## Future Integration and Growth

This project's infrastructure setup serves as a foundational framework that can evolve and integrate seamlessly into more complex architectures. As the project advances, it provides a robust groundwork for incorporating additional layers, such as database servers, caching layers, and application serversâ€”eventually evolving into a three-tier or LAMP stack architecture.

By starting with a scalable and well-architected foundation, this project not only fulfills its immediate hosting needs but also acts as a stepping stone for future expansion and learning. It offers the opportunity to explore and implement more advanced architectural patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of how to design, deploy, and manage sophisticated systems.
